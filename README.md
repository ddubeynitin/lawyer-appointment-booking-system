# lawyer-appointment-booking-system
This project is a web-based application designed to facilitate seamless appointment booking between clients and lawyers. The system will allow clients to view lawyer availability, schedule appointments, and receive confirmations. Lawyers will be able to manage their schedules, accept or decline appointments, and maintain client records.
